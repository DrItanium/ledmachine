The led84 machine is an attiny84 with an internal stack machine interpreter
meant to make manipulation of three separate PWMs simpler to do. The program
must be compiled into the sketch at this time. I have plans to make a version
which uses an SPI led driver combined with an SPI flash/fram chip as well.
