The LEDMachine is a specification for programmatically controlling LEDs through
a series of PWMs on ATTTiny8{4,5,8} based microcontrollers.

The basic form of the machine has a winbond W25Q32JV 32mbit SPI flash module
mated to an attiny8x microcontroller. The machine has 16-bit instructions and a
24-bit memory space where the majority of the space goes unused. There is
always a PWM pin exposed (two on the attiny84 based mcus) which is hooked up to
a 3.3v 5mm bright led. The instruction set evolved from being able to write
analog voltages, delay, and absolute jump to being a full fledged instruction
set. On the attiny84's there are enough pins to hook in a FRAM module as well
for persistent storage.


The idea for this machine came about from being able to program patterns on an
LED without having to constantly update the program found on the arduino
itself.
